------------------------------------------------------------------
## Overview

This project aims to streamline the client (distributor) registration process on the company portal.

- File upload capability for required documents:
- Proof of address, INE, Tax status, etc.
- Document preview, upload, delete, and help buttons.
- Support for Cash Dealer and Credit Dealer types.
- Support for status tracking of each request.
- Bifurcation in the documents to be uploaded based on the Credit Limit and Credit days


### Dealer Requests Module
- Complete data model to handle client data and documents.
- Acceptance and rejection of documents with reasoning.
- Request status updates (e.g., In Process, Accepted, Rejected).
- Automated notification of document status to clients and sales team.
